#### Framework for API Rest

```
I decided to use falcon because it's a micro-framework that is designed for building very 
fast micro-services. It is very flexible as it permits us to install add-ons and other 
libraries (e.g. Jinja2, SqlAlchemy, etc) easily. It encourages the REST architectural style, 
and tries to do as little as possible while remaining highly effectivem and its documentation 
is not so extensive and it's very understanble.

A good explanation:
